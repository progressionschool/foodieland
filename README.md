# Project Setup and Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to our project repository! This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to get started with contributing to project efficiently. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth workflow.

## Cloning the Repository

First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Use the following command to do so:

```bash
git clone [URL-of-the-repository]
cd [repository-name]
```

Replace `[URL-of-the-repository]` with the actual URL of the repository and `[repository-name]` with the name of the repository you cloned.

## Initial Setup

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and check the existing assets and boilerplate code:

### Check Assets:
* Navigate to the `assets` directory:
```bash
cd assets
```
* Review all the files to familiarize yourself with the resources available for the project.

### Review Boilerplate Code:
* Explore the boilerplate code provided in the main directories. This might include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, among others.
* Understand the basic structure and setup to ensure that your contributions align with the project's standards.

## Managing Issues
### Review Open Issues:
* Visit the 'Issues' section of the repository on GitHub.
* Carefully read through the descriptions and instructions of open issues to find one that matches your skills and interests.

### Time Management:
* Each issue should have an estimated completion time noted. Plan your schedule accordingly to complete issues within the given deadlines.

## Branching Strategy

For each issue you decide to work on, create a separate branch using the following naming convention:

* **Feature Branches:** `feature/issue-<issue-number>-short-description`

Examples:
```bash
# For a feature related to adding navbar functionality
git checkout -b feature/issue-42-add-navbar
```

## Contribution Process

1. **Branch Out:**
   * Always create a new branch for your work, following the naming convention provided above.
   * Ensure you're working on the correct branch with `git status`.

2. **Make Changes:**
   * Implement the necessary changes or improvements as described in the issue.
   * Frequently commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages.

3. **Push Changes:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin [your-branch-name]
   ```
   * Replace `[your-branch-name]` with the name of your branch.

4. **Open a Pull Request:**
   * Once you have completed the changes, open a pull request from your branch to the main branch.
   * Ensure you provide a clear description of the changes and reference the issue number.

5. **Code Review:**
   * Wait for the code review and respond to any feedback.
